#+TITLE: For The Web! Getting started.

Since *For The Web!(FTW!)* has aspects of everything for the web,
choosing an entry point in order to get started is either trivial, if
you know what you want to do, or difficult, if you do not.

As luck would have it, this document outlines it from all angles (or
will do so when it, along with *FTW!*, has a wee bit more ), so the
choice is yours.

* A simple web page

In all honestly, much of the work I personally do for the web is
ultimately presented to the user as an HTML5 page.

Therefore, given such, it is a decent place to get started.

** Generating

According to [[http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/a-minimal-html5-document/][some google-fu]], the minimal HTML5 is as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang=en>
  <head>
  <meta charset=utf-8>
  <title>blah</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>I'm the content</p>
  </body>
  </html>
#+END_SRC

Using that description, a function to generate is trivial.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (import :ftw/shtml5)

  (def (html5-page title: (title "blah") body: (body '((p "I'm the content"))))
    (shtml5-page->string
     `(html
       (@ (lang "en"))
       (head (meta (@ (charset utf8)))
	     (title ,title))
       (body ,@(if (and (list? body)
			(list? (car body)))
		 body
		 (list body))))))	  	 
#+END_SRC
