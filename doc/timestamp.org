#+TITLE: Timestamps : RFC 1123

* Intro

#+begin_quote
HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats for the
representation of date/time stamps:

      Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
      Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
      Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format

The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents a
fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123
#+end_quote

* Usage

The first real use is the modification time of a file. The browsers and servers
often use this for caching purposes.

#+begin_src scheme
(import :drewc/ftw/timestamp
 (only-in :gerbil/gambit/os
          file-info-last-modification-time
          file-info))

(def (file-modification-rfc-1123-date pathname)
  (rfc-1123-date<-gambit/os-time
   (file-info-last-modification-time (file-info pathname))))
#+end_src

That does what we need.

#+begin_src scheme
(file-modification-rfc-1123-date "/etc/passwd")
;; => "Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:35:43 GMT"
#+end_src

* File ~ftw/timestamp.ss~
#+begin_src scheme :tangle ../ftw/timestamp.ss
(import :clan/timestamp
        :std/srfi/19
        (rename-in :gerbil/gambit/os (time? time??)))

(export #t (import: :clan/timestamp))

(def rfc-1123-format-string "~a, ~d ~b ~Y ~H:~M:~S GMT")

(def (rfc-1123-date<-date date)
  (date->string date rfc-1123-format-string))

(def (rfc-1123-date<-timestamp timestamp)
  (rfc-1123-date<-date (date<-unix-timestamp timestamp)))

(def (rfc-1123-date<-srfi-19-time time)
  (rfc-1123-date<-timestamp (unix-timestamp<-srfi-19-time time)))

(def (rfc-1123-date<-gambit/os-time time)
  (rfc-1123-date<-srfi-19-time
   (make-time 'time-utc 0
              (inexact->exact (time->seconds time)))))
